an area that enterprises \nare increasingly investing in or identifying as a potential area of growth. There are many reasons enterprises invest in machine learning, from being able to leverage data to find insights about their customers to making processes more efficient. In this book, we break down how machine learning models are built into six steps: data access and collection, data preparation and exploration, model build and train, model evaluation, model deployment, and model monitoring. \nBuilding a machine learning model is an iterative \nprocess. Many of the steps needed to build a machine learning model are reiterated and modified until data scientists are satisfied with the model performance. This process requires a great deal of data exploration, visualization and experimentation as each step must be explored, modified and audited independently.

Data access \nand collection \n3/\n3/ The first step to a machine learning problem is \naccessing the data. Typically, data scientists will obtain the data for the business problems they are working on by querying the databases where their companies store their data. In addition, there is a lot of value in unstructured datasets that do not fit well into a relational database (e.g. logs, raw texts, images, videos, etc.). These datasets are heavily processed via Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines written by data engineers and data scientists. These datasets either reside in a data lake or in a database (either relational or not). When data scientists do not have the data needed to solve their problems, they can get the data by scraping data from websites, purchasing data from data providers or collecting the data from surveys, clickstream data, sensors, cameras, etc.", "start_char_idx": 6, "end_char_idx": 888, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "297160f2-1c5e-46b2-b0d4-cb71c69c5ee4": {"__data__": {"id_": "297160f2-1c5e-46b2-b0d4-cb71c69c5ee4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_path": "documents\\coe_demo\\data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7899425, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5958d0f8-79b4-479b-93da-0d17aae09e56", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_path": "documents\\coe_demo\\data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7899425, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-29"}, "hash": "311c1f6d5e447aad1e6bd69c3144776585729ec25e6deb470e4eba83c77367a2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "and make decisions about any necessary data \n4/ II. Data preparation and exploration \nSource: Scikit Learn Library https:// \nscikit-learn.org/, Visualization \nperformed with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science https:// docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/ data-science/using/data-science.htm After getting the data, data scientists have to \nprepare the raw data, perform data exploration, visualize data, transform data and possibly repeat the steps until it\u2019s ready to use for modeling. Data preparation is cleansing and processing raw data before analysis. Before building any machine learning model, data scientists need to understand the available data. Raw data can be messy, duplicated or inaccurate. Data scientists explore the data available to them, then cleanse the data by identifying corrupt, inaccurate and incomplete data and replacing or deleting it. \nIn addition, data scientists need to determine if \nthe data has labels or not. For example, if you have a series of images and you want to develop a detection model to determine whether there is a car in the image, you need to have a set of images labeled whether there is a car in them and most likely need bounding boxes around the cars in the images. If the images lack labels, data scientists will have to label them. There are open source tools and commercial vendors that provide platforms for data labeling, as well as human labelers for hire. \nAfter data is cleansed, data scientists explore \nthe features (or the variables) in their dataset, identify any relationship between the features transformations. There are various tools data scientists can use for exploratory data analysis in open source libraries and analytics/data science platforms. A tool that performs statistical analysis of the dataset and creates data visualizations to generate plots of the features is useful in this step. \nIt is important to see what types of features are \nin the dataset. Features can be numerical, which can be a floating point or integer. Categorical features have a finite number of possible values, typically assigning data into groups. For example, if you have a dataset from a customer survey, the respondent\u2019s gender (male or female) is a categorical feature. Ordinal features are a categorical feature with a set order or scale. For example, customer satisfaction response: very satisified, satisfied, indifferent, dissatisfied, and very dissatisfied has a set order to it. You can convert that ordering into an integer scale (1->5). After determining what kind of features there are, obtaining a distribution of values that each of the feature has and getting summary statistics of each feature would be next. Doing so would help answer the following questions about the dataset: \n\u0097Is the dataset skewed towards a range of values \nor a subset of categories? \n\u0097What are the minimum, maximum, mean, me-dian and mode values of the feature? \n\u0097Are there missing values or invalid values such as null? If so, how many are there? \n\u0097Are there outliers in the dataset? \nDuring the data exploration step, it is helpful to plot the features and also plot the features against each other to identify patterns in the dataset. This helps to determine the need for data transformation. Some of the questions you need to answer are: \n\u0097How do you handle missing values? Do you \nwant to fill in the values and if so, what ap-proach do you plan to take to fill in for the missing value? Some approaches include taking the mean value, the median, the mode, nearby entry\u2019s value and average of nearby entries\u2019 values. \n\u0097How will you handle outliers? \n\u0097Are some of your features correlated with each other? \n\u0097Do you need to normalize the dataset or per-form some other transformation to rescale the data (e.g. log transformation)? \n\u0097What is your approach to a long tail of categor-ical values? Do you use them as-is, group them in some meaningful way or ignore a subset of them altogether? \nSummary statistics and visualization of features in a dataset of three types of wine and features of each wine.", "start_char_idx": 33, "end_char_idx": 4090, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41f663f5-ab51-4223-887a-92d57a65f195": {"__data__": {"id_": "41f663f5-ab51-4223-887a-92d57a65f195", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_path": "documents\\coe_demo\\data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7899425, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "064f1ff0-01bb-4c88-bf43-3bc28ed583a6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_path": "documents\\coe_demo\\data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7899425, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-29"}, "hash": "573fed095e6bcb0e4efb11579bd6078bfc8c94296bfe3a839e94f3236e8404d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "5/\ntarget \u2014 \nalcohol \u2014 \nmalic_acid \u2014 \nash \u2014 \nalcalinity_of_ash \u2014 \nmagnesium \u2014 \ntotal_phenols \u2014 \nflavanoids \u2014 \nnonflavanoid_phenols \u2014 \nproanthocyanins \u2014 \ncolor_intensity \u2014 \nhue \u2014 \nod280/od315_of_diluted_wines \u2014 \nproline \u2014 \ntarget \u2014\nalcohol \u2014\nmalic_acid \u2014\nash \u2014\nalcalinity_of_ash \u2014\nmagnesium \u2014\ntotal_phenols \u2014\nflavanoids \u2014\nnonflavanoid_phenols \u2014\nproanthocyanins \u2014\ncolor_intensity \u2014\nhue \u2014\nod280/od315_of_diluted_wines \u2014\nproline \u2014 \nDuring the data exploration step, you can identify \npatterns in your dataset for ideas about how to develop new features that would better represent the dataset. This is known as feature engineering. For example, if you have a traffic dataset for the number of vehicles passing through a major intersection at every hour, you might want to create a new feature categorizing the hour into different parts of the day, such as early morning, mid-morning, early afternoon, late afternoon, and nighttime. \nFor categorical features, often it is necessary to \none hot encode the feature. One hot encoding means turning a categorical feature into binary features, one for each of the categories.

Model build and train \nModel build consists of choosing the correct \nmachine learning models to solve the problems and features that go into the models. In the first step of model build, data scientists need to decide what might be the appropriate machine learning model to solve the problem. There are two main types of machine learning models: supervised and unsupervised. Supervised learning involves modeling a set of input data to an output or a label. Classification and regression are supervised learning problems. Unsupervised learning involves modeling a set of input data without a label. For example, customer segmentation is an unsupervised learning problem. You do not know a priori what customer segment a customer belongs to. The segment will be assigned by the model. \nDifferent classes of machine learning models \nare used to solve unsupervised and supervised learning problems. Typically, data scientists will try multiple models and algorithms and generate multiple model candidates. Data scientists do not know a priori what model will perform best on the dataset, so they experiment with several of them. During the model training, a data scientist might do feature selection which is the process of selecting only a subset of features as input to the machine learning model. The benefits of reducing the number of input variables are to reduce computational cost of model training, make the model more generalizable and possibly improve model performance. \nDuring the model training, the dataset is split up \ninto training and testing sets. The training dataset is used to train the model, and the testing dataset is used to see how well the model performs on data it has not seen. Model evaluation will be discussed in more detail below. \nModel hyperparameter tuning is a major task in \nthe model training process. Models are algorithms, and hyperparameters are the knobs that a data scientist can tune to improve the performance of the model. For example, the depth of a decision tree is a hyperparameter. \nYou can choose to have a very deep or very \nshallow decision tree. This will affect the bias and variance of your model. Bias is the error from underfitting or the error from not capturing the relation between the features and the outputs. Variance is the error from overfitting where the model does well in the training dataset but does not perform well to unseen data. Tuning the hyperparameters of a model can be partially automated, although data scientists should always be involved in the process.  \n6/ \nData scientists also have to decide what kind of compute resources they need for training their models. You can prepare the data and train the models locally on your computer. However, depending on how much data there is to prepare and then used to train the model, your computer may not be enough. You may have to transition the workload to the cloud where you can have access to a broader selection of computing resources including GPUs. \nSome models can be trained faster on specialized \nhardware (e.g., training perceptrons/deep neural network models on GPUs.) You may also explore distributed training environments that can speed up the process, especially when the amount of data cannot fit in the memory of the largest machine available, through splitting and distributing the data across multiple machines, or when you want to simultaneously train multiple model candidates in parallel on separate machines.", "start_char_idx": 15, "end_char_idx": 3476, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2867b2ac-fbdc-41b5-90fb-e5057f66a0f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "2867b2ac-fbdc-41b5-90fb-e5057f66a0f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_path": "documents\\coe_demo\\data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7899425, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1c632f5c-d883-4ecc-b0d4-3de1ffee6b02", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_path": "documents\\coe_demo\\data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7899425, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-29"}, "hash": "9dd7dc3798678cc56ab451c450fe9567639265df068c3627ad4c8ca7b9b0e39b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "7/\nAutoML has garnered quite a bit of attention over \nthe past few years due to the promise of being able to make machine learning more accessible to a larger audience. AutoML stands for automated machine learning. It automates the process of feature selection, model/algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning. It is a feature that all major data science platforms have. Users can feed a dataset to AutoML, and it will train multiple machine learning models, tune the hyperparameters for those models, and evaluate their performance against each other. \nAutoML can improve the productivity of data \nscientists by automating the training process. It also allows data analysts and developers to build machine learning models without tweaking every aspect of the model training process that comes with data science expertise. Most AutoML capabilities support tabular data for classification and regression problems while others have more advanced offerings that support images and text data, as well as time series forecasting. \nThe drawback to AutoML, or any complicated \nmodel, is it can seem like a blackbox solution making it difficult for users to understand how the models arrive at the predictions. Users should look to the model explainability offering of the AutoML system to see what capability exists to help users interpret the models and understand how the selected models arrive at the predictions. \n7/ AutoML \nModel explanations typically fall into global explanation and local explanation. Global explanation is understanding the general behavior of a machine learning model as a whole. This includes explaining how important each feature is in contributing to the model predictions. Local explanation provides an understanding on why the machine learning model made a particular prediction for one data sample. For example, why did a fraud detection algorithm predict a particular transaction as fraudulent?", "start_char_idx": 7, "end_char_idx": 1933, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aaa41831-7851-4455-b85d-5411bb22804b": {"__data__": {"id_": "aaa41831-7851-4455-b85d-5411bb22804b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_path": "documents\\coe_demo\\data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7899425, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1d3dc435-f556-481e-858c-094213f43ab0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_path": "documents\\coe_demo\\data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7899425, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-29"}, "hash": "83739d99c3406e1970685476df8a5a92b9f36509b6002c25ff709a9bcfebbb03", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "1\n8/]1[ .0\n1] [0 .0 0 ] [0 .0 0\n]1[ 3 4 .0 0] 0 [2 7 .8 0 ] [2 7 8 .0 0\n] [0 .0 0 ] [0 .0 0 ] 61[ .0\n1IV.

Model deployment \nAfter the model training and evaluation processes \nare complete, the best candidate models are saved. Models are usually saved in Pickle, ONNX and PMML format. Depending on the objectives, data scientists might work on a machine learning problem for proof of concept, experimentation or to deploy it to production. Model deployment is consuming the predictions made by the machine learning model in some way. Most likely, the pipeline of data transformations have to be deployed also. Typically, data scientists will work with engineers on model deployment. \nDepending on how you intend to consume the \npredictions, you can deploy for batch consumption or real time consumption. For batch consumption, the predictions can be scheduled (e.g., every hour, every day.) The predictions can then be stored in a database and consumed by other applications. Typically, the amount of data you process is larger than for real-time prediction. A use case would be if you run an e-commerce site and you want to send a weekly email to the customers about recommended products for them based on past purchases. The machine learning models can be scheduled to run ahead of time. For real-time consumption, a trigger would initiate the process of using the persisted model to serve a prediction. For example, deciding whether a transaction is fraudulent or not when payment is initiated, requires real-time prediction. You have to consider how quickly you have to serve the predictions (milliseconds, seconds?), the volume of demand for the service, and the size of data to run predictions on. Minimizing latency to serve prediction is important. You can improve the serving latency by using a smaller model in size, using accelerators such as GPU and improving how features related to the entity are retrieved for real-time prediction (e.g. If you are recommending products to a user as the user is browsing a site, improvements on how information on past purchases of the user is fetched can improve the latency.) \nThere are different tools and cloud platform \nofferings for model deployment such as Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms, fully managed deployment of models as HTTP endpoints, DIY with flask or Django in a container orchestration platform such as k8 and docker swarm, etc. \n9/", "start_char_idx": 20, "end_char_idx": 2323, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bcccde3c-5260-453b-8e32-f3ec56cbdd2e": {"__data__": {"id_": "bcccde3c-5260-453b-8e32-f3ec56cbdd2e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_path": "documents\\coe_demo\\data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7899425, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67b4197d-3a20-44a9-907c-5ae4b422c29e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_path": "documents\\coe_demo\\data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7899425, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-29"}, "hash": "bbad27005e60adc543b855e76be0d3d7c9c4dfeec3c9b018b8831e525ab76f8c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "VI. Model monitoring \nModel monitoring is a challenging step that is \nsometimes forgotten by organizations without mature machine learning and data science initiatives. Model retraining and redeployment requires time from the data science and engineering team and compute resources. Model monitoring helps the team decide if and when it is necessary to retrain the model and redeploy. Model monitoring can be broken down into two components: drift/statistical monitoring of the model performance and ops monitoring. \nAfter models are deployed, the metrics by which \nthe models were measured and trained go down in production. This is because data is non-stationary. The non-stationarity can manifest in many ways: features in production data can take values outside of the range in the training dataset; there can be a slow drift in the distribution of the values, etc. \nBecause of the model degradation, the quality \nof the models need to be monitored to decide if and when to retrain the model and redeploy. Sometimes, it is not possible to immediately obtain the prediction accuracy of live data going to a production system. For example, it might take some time before you can decide whether a \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \nchurn prediction model or a fraud detection model provided an accurate prediction. However, it is possible to look at the statistics and distribution of the training data compared to live data and also compare the distribution of the model predictions with training and live data. For example, if you are working with a customer churn model, you can compare the features of your customers used to train your model compared to the features of customers in the production system. Also, you can look at the percentage of customers predicted to churn in the training sample compared to the live production. \nOps monitoring of the machine learning system will \nrequire partnership between the data scientists and engineering team. Things to monitor include serving latency, memory/CPU usage, throughput and system reliability. Logs and metrics need to be set up for tracking and monitoring. Logs contain records of events, along with the time when they occurred. They can be used to investigate specific incidents and figure out the cause of the incident. Kibana is an open-source tool used for searching and viewing logs. Metrics measure the usage and behavior of the machine learning system. Prometheus and Grafana \nare tools for monitoring metrics. \n10/", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2481, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc66d8fe-04c5-497f-95d4-cb2136cf4317": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc66d8fe-04c5-497f-95d4-cb2136cf4317", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_path": "documents\\coe_demo\\data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7899425, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dcd85d9d-a8f8-47d4-aa70-5f04b4c3b992", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_path": "documents\\coe_demo\\data-science-lifecycle-ebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7899425, "creation_date": "2024-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-29"}, "hash": "dd46fa47f6da3a4dc7d34cac2ecd4712add0ea215bd94dd307921c3343ac55b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Conclusion \nWe hope this has been a useful guide on the steps \nit takes to build a machine learning model.
